Hi, my name is Urvish Patel, and currently, I am an International student at the University of Colorado, Denver (Business School), majoring in master’s Business Analytics.

From the first day of my undergraduate, data intrigued me. I loved solving puzzles and finding patterns in large data sets.

I also have ten months of experience as a junior .Net Developer where majorly I used to create CRM (Client Relationship Management) applications with C# language, which included creating stored procedures & views in the database.

During my master’s I have worked on various languages and visualization tools such as R, Python, PowerBi & Tableau. 

You can reach me through e-mail at patelurvish130@gmail.com.
