Hi, my name is Urvish Patel, and currently, I am an International student at the University of Colorado, Denver (Business School), majoring in master’s Business Analytics.

From the first day of my undergraduate, data intrigued me. I loved solving puzzles and finding patterns in large data sets.

During my master’s I have worked on various languages and visualization tools such as R, Python, PowerBi & Tableau. 

I also have ten months of experience as a junior .Net Developer where majorly I used to create CRM (Client Relationship Management) applications with C# language, which included creating stored procedures & views in the database.

I have also worked as a Data Insights Analyst at Hunter Douglas Inc, the experience allowed me to utilize my SQL, python & visualization through Tableau skills to achieve the tasks assigned to me. I was responsible for producing Weekly & Monthly executive reports and accommodating internal and external requests on Reports & Tableau Dashboards. My main project as an intern was to code in python to automate reports using API of various types such as Explore API. In addition, I was also in charge of updating the data source of various dashboards weekly. In addition, I was able to identify, analyze and propose solutions to a significant problem that I encountered while working at Hunter Douglas Inc. I used and learned new technologies such as SAP Analytics Cloud for visualization, Salesforce for reporting, Talk-desk for Reporting and Genesys as a data source.
